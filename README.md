# C++ Projects
Here I store all the things that I have learned about C++ as a beginner
## Installng the compiler

### Step 1
* Download MinGW from [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/).
### Step 2
* Install MinGW by opening your download location.
### Step 3
* After the installation open the program and <u>check(âœ…) all the boxes</u>.
### Step 4
* From the top of the window select the "Installation" tab and click on <u> Apply Changes</u> and wait for the installation to finish
### Step 5
* Open a new system shell and type `g++ --help`. If you get a long output with random things you have successfully installed the compiler.

###### Start learning from folder 01. Read the explanation comments to get a better idea of how everything in the program works. You only will need to run Source.cpp files. Feel free to open a new issue or pull request if you found something wrong.
